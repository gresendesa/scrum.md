## Sprint Planning

```yaml
section: constitution.sprint-planning
title: Sprint Planning
status: active
owner: "{{ owner }}"
required: true
tags: [sprint, planning, scrum]
```

Every sprint must go through formal planning, conducted by the agent with owner participation.

During planning, the following are mandatory:

1. Ask the PO for the priority of eligible backlog items.
2. Register or update the `PO Priority` field in the backlog.
3. Select backlog items for the sprint according to PO priority.
4. Decompose selected items into technical tasks.
5. Calculate risk per task and aggregated sprint risk.
6. Define execution order.
7. Register expected blockers and mitigations.

### Task Risk Scale

```yaml
section: constitution.sprint-planning.task-risk-scale
title: Task Risk Scale
status: active

  high: 3
tags: [risk, planning]
```

* `medium` = 2
* `high` = 3

### Sprint Risk Calculation

```yaml
section: constitution.sprint-planning.sprint-risk-calculation
title: Sprint Risk Calculation
status: active
owner: "{{ owner }}"
method: simple_weighted_average
classification:
  low: "<= 1.4"
  medium: "> 1.4 and <= 2.3"
  high: "> 2.3"
tags: [risk, planning]
```

Sprint risk must be calculated as the simple weighted average of the risks of the selected tasks.

Final classification:

* `<= 1.4`: low
* `> 1.4 and <= 2.3`: medium
* `> 2.3`: high

## Sprint Closing Gate

```yaml
section: constitution.sprint-closing-gate
title: Sprint Closing Gate

## Agent Memory Management

```yaml
section: constitution.agent-memory-management
title: Agent Memory Management
status: active
owner: "{{ owner }}"
memory_root: scrum/
tags: [memory, agent, governance]
```

The `scrum/` directory is the operational memory of the project and must follow these rules.

[@include: MDBind notation policy](CONSTITUTION.md#constitution.agent-memory-management.mdbind-notation-policy)
[@ref: Backlog consolidator](backlog.md#backlog)
[@ref: Sprint consolidator](sprint.md#sprints)
[@ref: Experience memory](experience.md#experience)
[@ref: Decision memory](decisions.md#decisions)

### MDBind Notation Policy

```yaml
section: constitution.agent-memory-management.mdbind-notation-policy
title: MDBind Notation Policy
status: active
owner: "{{ owner }}"
tool: mdbind
repository: https://github.com/gresendesa/mdbind
required: true
tags: [mdbind, graph, memory, links]
```

All Markdown files created or updated by the AI in the project memory must use `mdbind` notation.

Each relevant Markdown section must be treated as an addressable graph node and must include a YAML metadata block immediately after the heading.

The YAML metadata block must include, at minimum:

* `section`

The `section` value must be globally unique within the repository.

The AI must use `@ref` or `@include` links whenever it understands that a relationship between sections is necessary for one or more of the following purposes:

* historical composition;
* reinforcement of relevant context;
* contextualization of decisions, tasks, incidents, architecture, backlog items, or sprint records;
* traceability between related records;
* dependency mapping;
* impact analysis;
* future retrieval by agents;
* composition of a larger document from smaller memory nodes.

Use `@include` when the target section should be expanded inline during document composition.

Use `@ref` when the target section should be linked as a dependency or contextual reference, without embedding its content.

The AI must prefer `@ref` over `@include` when the relationship is useful for traceability but the target content does not need to be embedded in the composed document.

The AI must prefer `@include` when the target content is structurally necessary to understand or materialize the current document.

The AI must avoid creating broken graph edges. Any `@ref` or `@include` target must point to an existing file and an existing `section`.

Before closing a sprint or marking a memory update as complete, the AI should validate the `mdbind` graph whenever the tool is available.

Recommended validation command:

```bash
mdb validate --root scrum/
```
